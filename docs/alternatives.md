**DIFFERENCES**:

  * Much more than analysis tools (Wider scope)

**PRO**:

  * Library first design
  * Has a GUI for non-power users

**CON**:

  * Our tests show poor performance compared to other SPICE engines, but milage may vary
  * Documentation is poor. Have to look at code to understand and use properly.
  * Margin analysis limited to binary search
  * Releases are not consistent between windows/linux and source code lags releases
  * Optimizer works in fixed step sizes and runs a sequence of single parameter optimizations.
    * Works well in certain cases, but returns far from optimal values in other cases.
