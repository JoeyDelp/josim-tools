**PSCAN2**
http://www.pscan2sim.org/index.html

PSCAN2 is a superconductor circuit simulator, based on ideas and experience from development of PSCAN, PSCAN96, and Julia simulators, written by Pavel Shevchenko. It is implemented as a Python module, which can load the circuit netlist, circuit parameters, and description of expected circuit behavior, and when perform transient simulation of the circuit. There are functions to run circuit simulation, calculate margins or circuit parameters, and optimize circuit parameters.
